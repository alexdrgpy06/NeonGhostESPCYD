## 2024-05-22 - Visual Feedback on Touch
**Learning:** On embedded touchscreens without haptic feedback, immediate visual confirmation (like color inversion) is critical for "tactile" feel. Users often double-tap if they don't see an instant reaction.
**Action:** Always implement a pressed/active state for touchable elements, even if the action is blocking or slow.
